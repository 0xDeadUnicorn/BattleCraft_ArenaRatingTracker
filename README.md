# Arena Rating Tracker

![ArenaRatingTracker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85343c64-ae44-4c4f-b2e8-56b5d9040bae)

This addon tracks changes in your arena rating across all brackets. It provides real-time updates on your rating progress, allowing you to monitor your performance in rated arenas.

Important Note: If you leave an arena before it concludes, the addon may not function correctly due to potential server delays in rating updates. Please be aware that this issue may vary depending on the server.

*Compatible with WoTLK 3.3.5*
